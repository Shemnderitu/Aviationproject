# ✈️ Aircraft Risk Profiling for Business Expansion

## 📘 Project Overview

As part of a strategic diversification initiative, the company is exploring opportunities in aviation — specifically purchasing and operating aircraft for commercial and private enterprises. However, without prior industry knowledge, understanding the **safety and risk profiles of various aircraft** is essential before any acquisition.

This project leverages historical accident data from the **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)** to identify aircraft with the **lowest risk** based on frequency, severity, and trends from 1962 to 2023.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze aircraft accident data to quantify risk by make/model.
- Develop a custom **Severity Score** to evaluate incidents.
- Use **data science** techniques to clean, aggregate, and model the data.
- Deliver insights through **visualizations and an interactive dashboard**.
- Provide **three actionable recommendations** to guide safe aircraft acquisition.

---

## 🔧 Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning & Imputation**: Handling missing and inconsistent data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom severity scoring based on injury outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Seaborn and Matplotlib for dynamic data exploration.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: (Streamlit or Dash, depending on implementation)
- **Business Communication**: Visual storytelling and clear recommendations using Tableau and PowerPoint.

---

## 📊 Key Deliverables

- ✅ **Jupyter Notebook**: Full analysis with code, visuals, and interpretations.
- ✅ **Interactive Dashboard**: Explore aircraft safety data by filters and risk categories.
- ✅ **Business Presentation**: A non-technical deck highlighting insights and recommendations.
- ✅ **GitHub Repository**: Version-controlled, reproducible codebase for collaboration and deployment.

## 📈 Sample Outputs

- Top 10 safest aircraft models by severity and accident frequency.
- Risk categories (Low, Moderate, High) derived via clustering.
- Time trends in accident frequency by aircraft make/model.
- Aircraft recommendation list optimized for business safety.

## 🧠 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis:
1. Focus on acquiring low-risk aircraft models.
2. Avoid high-risk aircraft models.
3. Focus on aircraft models with the lowest accident counts.
4. Focus on operations during the safest weather conditions.
5. Focus on improving safety in the most accident-prone locations.
